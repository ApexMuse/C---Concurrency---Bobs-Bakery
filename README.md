# C---Concurrency---Bobs-Bakery
C program that simulates concurrent behavior

Bob’s bakery has two bakers, one that only makes cupcakes and the other only makes donuts. Cupcakes are produced every two seconds and donuts are produced every second. The bakery however can only store at most ten cupcakes and fifteen donuts. The bakery can only accommodate at most five customers at a time. Each customer buys a cupcake, a donut or both.

Write a single C or C++ program that simulates the concurrent behavior in Bob’s Bakery. The program should display messages before and after the bakers produce product and before and after the customer buys a product. The program should avoid deadlock, race conditions, starvation and livelock. Write a main that demonstrates the working code.
